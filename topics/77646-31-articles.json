If you have a full RCS package, you can design control software around any CoM and moment of inertia tensor you end up with. But if you want to rely on magnetic torque, these are very important factors. I can tell you right away that orientation of principal axes will be critical. But I couldn\u0027t tell you without simulation how well that will play with shifting center of pressure on solar panels. Torque is one thing, but if you get an unexpected tumble, it could be really bad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027d hold off on actual physical layout. We should definitely be talking about what components are actually needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far, I have penned down main board with CPU, additional memory, GPS chip, and amps/drivers for any sensor/actuators; 6 square coils, one for each side, to provide magnetic torque; two cameras, one forward looking, one for the experiment; transceiver, probably an S-band; solar panels and a small battery; and a bunch of sensors. We can probably use off-the-shelf thermistors for board/frame temperature, some accelerometers to get rough values on rotation, magnetometers for rough orientation, and maybe some light sensors for sun/horizon detection etc. And, of course, depending on experiment, there could be a whole host of additional sensors. Precise temperature, pressure, humidity, oxygen, CO2, etc. There is a lot of room for improvement in each category, however. And that\u0027s going to be the hard part of designing things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you can think of anything I\u0027m missing, let me know. But this should do for basic operations. The design will mostly include figuring out which of the above will be on the main board, and which we will wire, putting together a frame to hold it all together, and lots of testing for just about everything. It\u0027d be nice to try and build a frame in a comparatively inexpensive way, because I\u0027d like to drop a few mockups from different height and record damage vs acceleration experienced on impact by accelerometers. (Accelerometers and off-the-shelf CPU/MPU to do the readings are cheap enough to sacrifice.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have been looking at some 3D printers, but I still haven\u0027t looked up how reliable 3D printed plastics would be in space. On the other hand, it\u0027s just the thing for mockups and rapid prototyping. So hopefully, by winter, we\u0027ll have that option for testing things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and you\u0027ve mentioned organizational aspects at some point.

I\u0027d also like to see more than one person per item. Knowing who has practical experience in these would help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis list would include:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- A comparison of successful and failed cubesat missions. One component manufacturer\u0027s website I checked out claimed a 50% failure rate for university cubesats, not counting launch failure. We need to do better, and understanding why they fail is the only way. Correspondence with some of the creators would be a good idea and should be documented.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Any and all available literature on partial-gravity biology, if we indeed decide to go that route. We also need to read up on Earth-normal botany and plants in microgravity. The latter two are slightly less important, as our experiment would not be quite as result-driven but rather demonstrate a method that has not been tried.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- We need to start looking at attitude control. K^2, I know you\u0027re looking into this and seem to have some electronics \u0026amp; software experience. We need to get this right because the design we have been discussing implies it. It will also be critical for future missions, if we get that far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Legal matters. ITAR probably doesn\u0027t apply to this project, but we need to do everything in a clear and organised manner so that we don\u0027t have problems. Especially true considering the international nature of the community.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Materials. I know that teflon and anodised aluminium are both used in spacecraft because they resist outgassing and cold-welding. For the components we wish to build, which materials are flight-tested, and which are out of the question? Will we need to test any ourselves? Spacecraft electronics are sometimes given a coating to protect them against outgassing. There are some problems associated with this (especially w.r.t. fixing problems discovered during testing). Will it be a good idea in our case?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Thermal design. Most cubesats tumble freely, which helps to control the temperature. As ours will point one side to the sun, and as cubesats have high surface:volume ratios, we need to make sure that we don\u0027t cook or freeze the experiment or critical components.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Budgeting. We should try to gather information from the AMSAT/cubesat communities as well as consider what can be learned from traditional spaceflight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Crowdfunding. We should study the available literature on failed/successful crowdfunding efforts so that we know if, for example, a silly name would benefit or undermine a scientific project on Kickstarter et al. Giving out goodies such as mission patches seems to be required. But how much, and what? How many backer levels should there be for a Kickstarter project? How far apart should they be, monetarily? What percentage of the pledge should the rewards cost? How often should updates be posted? How big should the stretch goals be? How early or late in the funding process should they be added? Would it be an advantage to loudly associate the project with KSP players, or would it be better to put it in a footnote? (I.e., would we be taken more seriously if we emphasise ourselves as a community of spaceflight enthusiasts who happen to like KSP, or as a community of KSP players who want to reach out and teach/learn aerospace engineering in a practical manner as the game has done for many? Will something like \u0022JebSat\u0022 lure backers, or scare them off?) If necessary, we should do our own comparative studies. \u003Cem\u003EThis could make or break the project, especially if we\u0027re planning more missions.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWho has a ham licence or intends to get one? It\u0027s not critical right now but we will need to set up ground stations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoing some sort of educational outreach (even if it\u0027s just talking to schoolkids afterwards and showing off pictures of the satellite) would be a nice bonus. Would some people on the project be interested in that? We can also do education \u003Cem\u003Edirectly\u003C/em\u003E, by allowing kids on the forums to assist with some easier aspects of the design process and sharing information as the project progresses. This would however take a little extra work. Would you be interested?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot a literature study, but we should start brainstorming ideas for artwork, names and related things. I recommend that we designate different levels of seriousness. When we see everything together, and when we have more data on the crowdfunding requirements, we would be better able to judge how serious we should sound and pick the best in each category.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s what I have in mind.

So I understand, engineering and designing LATER, first simulations. Though on the hardware you mentioned, that all has to fit in a 0.5U area, because the other half will be taken up by the pressurized area. I see how that is possible (They sell 0.5U on many CubeSat websites), but since we will also need systems controlling the pressurized area, which will certainly be a tight squeeze. So we will probably haft to use \u0022Home-made\u0022 components, which is fine. Also, maybe you should make a reasonably good visualization of our CubeSat (Pressurized area with plants) and put it on the first post on the new thread you\u0027re going to make after you\u0027re done with the sim you\u0027re creating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Echristok, I say we name it KerbSat (But there still would be a poll here on the KSP forums), and we\u0027d probably hire a 3D graphic artist to make a visualization similar to the ones other crowd-funded CubeSats have.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VirtualCLD","CreatedById":81542,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-05T17:09:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022christok\u0022 data-cite=\u0022christok\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWho has a ham licence or intends to get one?
