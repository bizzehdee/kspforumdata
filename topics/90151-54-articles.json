They generally sort into two classes, however, guidance rings for LVs (large, support lots of mass, heavy (but light compared to supported mass), draw lots of power) and probe avionics (lighter, smaller, don\u0027t support much mass but don\u0027t draw much power). The octo2 that you presumably used is 1960-equivalent technology, so it\u0027ll be very bad compared to pretty much anything else. 15 charge/min is 250 watts--not a ton, but not nothing either. However, you just gave me an excellent idea.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I\u0027ve used the octo2 (first) which can control 0.2 tons with 3.0 EC/min. After upgrading RP-0, the octo2 was way too small, so I\u0027ve added a Able/Delta Avionics Package, which still is quite small, but uses 60 EC/min to control 8 tons of mass. What made me suspicious, is that the even larger ones for 12 tons (Agena Avionics \u0026amp; Agena D) again have just a power consumption of 15. But these are way to oversized (dimensions and power) for my satellite. While the smaller ones are far to weak to control a satellite with about 2 tons of mass, like mine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso 60 EC is quite a lot, at least for my taste. It\u0027s much more than any sattelite built by me so far consumes, even though I\u0027ve mounted 20 Commutron D and a dish-antenna on them. I\u0027ve had to unlock some none-RP-0 solar panels, so that six of them are just capable (1.2 times the output of the consumption) to feed the Delta Avionics Packes and the rest of the mounted stuff. If the sattelite has a bad angle to the sun, it\u0027s still not enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe even larger ones for rockets (Guidance Unit (early)) again use only 3, or 60 and 120 EC/min. But for those I dont really care much, since they are used in the ascent stages, which usually aren\u0027t carried around for hours or longer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor me it looks like an imbalance at the moment. But if you tell me, that they are balanced, or that this avionic packages even have some real counterparts with the same specifications, I\u0027m gonna live and play with it. But at least an option to deactivate the avionic units would be nice. The larger one could be used for steering and would be switched of, when the satellite reaches it\u0027s final orbit. While a smaller one keeps on working, doing the signal processing job for little EC/min.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW: We can continue this discussion in the RP-0 thread if you like.
