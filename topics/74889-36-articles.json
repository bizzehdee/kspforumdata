I love how you, in at first at least, just put the parts on the Mun in the same orientation. Then land the parts. Then... then things get interesting. First, let me say that I LOVE the idea of using jacks like that to give you room to work. Excellent thinking. The approach seems to be minimalist efficiency... different parts to alter the capabilities of the actual parts, and using the actual parts to get to actual space. Some assembly issues in space, but I can\u0027t fault you for that one, everyone hit those with the docking ports. The tour was nice, and you did put her down on Minmus. And what can I say? The arch-shot had to have taken some doing. And of course, an excellent powered landing on the VAB heliport. Well done! What I heart: The jacks, the vehicles that add modules, the arch shot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EForum Team 1:\u003C/strong\u003E Big bloody kickstand. I\u0027m a sucker for big builds! My first thought, was, \u0022Yeah, you got it vertical. What now, tough guy?\u0022 Then the other vehicles came around and ferried them off. O_o Wasn\u0027t expecting that! T-minus picture made me cringe, where it sagged off to the side. Cringing was for me, because there\u0027s nobody to blame there but me. That\u0027s all on me. I really thought she\u0027d link up fine. Oh well, live and learn. The launch was nice, that\u0027s pretty much how I went... just the Arkingthaad herself. Refuel ship was a nice big build! And aerobraking on Jool with an Arkingthaad. That\u0027s something I haven\u0027t even done. I haven\u0027t been to Jool yet, honestly. So points there. And you even also put her down on the VAB. I remember remarking once that I suspected that the Arkingthaad was somehow shrunk, given the second to last picture, but only know just remember I didn\u0027t go with a normal sized Arkingthaad haha. Well done, team!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EForum Team 2:\u003C/strong\u003E Not a full album here, no landings or tour. So I\u0027ll focus on the build here. First... I\u0027m gonna call that lifter you built a \u0022snout grabber\u0022. I think that\u0027s the first time I\u0027ve ever seen someone lift something by the nose. And it works! It appears to work really well! That\u0027s something I\u0027ve never considered. It\u0027s actually towing the leg modules. That\u0027s a new one on me! I like your tug, also. I can\u0027t give you full marks without tour or landing, but you put her together in orbit! Remember how many folks couldn\u0027t. So, kudos! If you got more pictures of the assembly you can add to that imgur album, be sure to do so! I\u0027d like to see more of what you put together. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EForum Team 3:\u003C/strong\u003E First team to do both photo album so I can check my memory, and a high production value youtube video. Well done on the latter, by the way! Ok, on to the build: I absolutely like the rover-booster-docking-system with what I\u0027ll call the high-five dock point reinforcement system. Drive \u0027em over, latch \u0027em on, high-five, and launch. Beautiful simplicity. The docking seemed a bit like trouble. I got the impression you were used to things just snapping into place. I can\u0027t help but wonder if more ports would\u0027ve locked if you lined them up a bit better before pressing them in. But regardless, you absolutely got the job done! The landing was good, though I cringed at how well she didn\u0027t hold together. That being my fault, again. The bouncyness of the legs were no surprise hehe... I did drop a hint, when I mentioned that the legs were capable of handling the weight of a fully fueled ship in Kerbin gravity. With less fuel and less gravity? Sproing? SPROING! And finally you were also the only team that also showed \u0022bloopers\u0022 or more specifically, builds you attempted that didn\u0027t pan out. Thank you!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd absolutely...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHonorable Mention:\u003C/strong\u003E Allhuran! Buddy, loved the video, I love how you tackled it anyway, despite almost assuredly the challenge being a major pain in the arse. And then to record it, edit it, et cetera, on such a rough time limitation. And as a solo act! Well done, man. I\u0027ve added the video to my favorites list. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E Buildwise? What the [expletive deleted] can I say? I love big builds, and I almost had a pico-stroke when that first bolt-on spaceplane rolled out. The wheel reinforcement was a stroke of genius. You even built different spaceplanes for the different sized parts! You make me regret not dabbling with spaceplanes more. And the micro RCS tugs you coopt the docking ports with? Another well thought out idea. And finally, you didn\u0027t land it, but I\u0027m not gonna fault ya, since you were intent on keeping a promise you made. You\u0027ve earned all the kudos-es.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, anyone else take a stab at this? I don\u0027t care if you succeeded or not, lemmie see what ya built!
