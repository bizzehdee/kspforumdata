I\u0027ve played around 800 hours of KSP, but given my playstyle and interests the furthest from Kerbin I\u0027ve ever been is Duna, twice. I tend to stick to designing jets and SSTOs with various mods like Ferram Aerospace Research, Advanced Jet Engine, Procedural Parts, B9 Wings, Intake Build Aid, Pilot Assistant, etc. I like to think I have a good enough grasp on plane and spaceplane design principals (in KSP-land) to assist some of the other members here, so I will be trying to give back to the community accordingly. However I\u0027ll definitely need some help in furthering my exploration of the Kerbin system! However my grand goal of the game, something I\u0027ve wanted to do since I\u0027ve learned it was even possible is to fly an SSTO from the KCC runway to a Laythe landing and back. Refueling is allowed, but I might limit myself to only launching/assembling fuel depots with SSTOs. Rockets are for losers right?"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T11:35:39Z","Content":"Hello Virtual Flyboy, and welcome to the forums!\n\nI guess you already know how great this community is, so you know where to ask and find answers to questions.\n\nHave you seen the [SSTO to Laythe and Beyond](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117415-SSTO-to-laythe-and-beyond) thread in the challenges section? It\u0027s not easy, but it can be done.\n\nI have to say I can\u0027t agree with the \u0027Rockets are for losers\u0027 statement there. There are a few holy flame wars around here and that statement could just set one off.\n\nI love spaceplanes, and they are often the main focus of my program, but I love rockets too. My first several months of play were exclusively with rockets until I learned enough to start building useable spaceplanes.\n\nHappy landings!"},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T12:32:43Z","Content":"Are rockets for losers? I don\u0027t think so. Spaceplanes tend to get more rep, but a well-built rocket has a lot of charm.\n\nGood luck on getting to Laythe!"},{"CreatedByName":"Virtual Flyboy","CreatedById":145842,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T12:49:40Z","Content":"I have not seen that challenge thread, so thanks for pointing me in the right direction, definitely some good ideas in there! While it is certainly possible to go there and back without any refueling, it doesn\u0027t seem to be practical for any crew onboard, which is something I consider in my selectively \u0022realistic\u0022 mindset. Often means SSTOs/any craft become bloated with extra, unoccupied cabin space if the trip is anywhere outside the Kerbin SOI. There are still plenty of things I wish to explore before that grand feat, so I hope to get squeeze some gravity assist practice in to make sure my burns out there are as minimal as possible.\n\nHere is a very small album of some recent KSP adventures. Currently on a newish save right now, first thing I did was set up a com-sat network using my KD-A3 Pegasus, an SSTO with ability to deploy small payloads into LKO.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/TVufd)\n\nRegarding my rockets are for losers statement, I definitely love them and continue to use them, I just find it funny to try and get by without them in a game that is essentially about them, proving the sandbox nature of KSP. Being an aviation nut doesn\u0027t help either. I can only hope people don\u0027t take a silly statement like that as anything more than what it is, a joking prod. I also stream on occasion, but I\u0027ll find the appropriate outlet to post that in whenever I\u0027m active, as it is rare enough.\n\nBut yeah, feels nice to find a forum that is all about the game you love, and the topics it involves. I\u0027ve been part of a Halo forum for 10 years, moderating 1/3 of that time. Surviving community was small and solid, but also stagnant, as many of us literally outgrew the game that brought us together, leading to mostly OT discussion, with me often talking aviation or space. Seems like I was definitely fishing in the wrong hole!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-31T14:22:57Z\u0022 title=\u002207/31/2015 02:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Virtual Flyboy**"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T13:40:27Z","Content":"To embed your imgur album, use this syntax with square brackets instead of curly ones. {IMGUR}TVufd{/IMGUR}\n\nNice pics, BTW.\n\nAs far as the rockets vs. spaceplanes thing, no worries.
