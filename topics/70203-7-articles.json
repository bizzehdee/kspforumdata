I\u0027ll play around with it some more and see if I can replicate the problem you are having. The first thing that comes to mind is to suggest that you turn off SAS right before the two parts dock if you haven\u0027t been.

I am able to get it work with the smaller one, but like marce I\u0027m not able to get it to work with the larger TCS Arched Cargo Frame V2. Strangely, it seems to have to do with orientation of that particular node.

If you place both sizes of the TCS Arched Cargo Frame V2 and then attempt to attach a stack decoupler to that node, you\u0027ll see that on the smaller frame you can get it to orientate correctly, but on the larger it will only place if the stack decoupler is rotated at a 90 degree angle from what is intended.
