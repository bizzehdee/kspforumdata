The flight surgeon and an assistant fitted Kleuger into one tank while two medical technicians arranged Joe in his. One of them asked, \u201CUnderwear smooth? No wrinkles?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0\u201CI guess.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0\u201CI\u2019ll check.\u201D He did so, then arranged fittings necessary to a man who must remain in one position for days. \u201CThe nipple left of your mouth is water; the two on your right are glucose and bouillon.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0\u201CNo solids?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0The surgeon turned in the air and answered, \u201CYou don\u2019t need any, you won\u2019t want any, and you mustn\u2019t have any. And be careful in swallowing.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0\u201CI\u2019ve boosted before.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0\u201CSure, sure. But be careful.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0Each tank was like an oversized bathtub filled with a liquid denser than water. The top was covered by a rubbery sheet, gasketed at the edges; during boost each man would float with the sheet conforming to his body. The Salamander being still in free orbit, everything was weightless and the sheet now served to keep the fluid from floating out. The attendants centered Appleby against the sheet and fastened him with sticky tape, then placed his own acceleration collar, tailored to him, behind his head.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen the counter flashed the last thirty seconds he forgot his foregone leave. The lust to travel possessed him. To go, no matter where, anywhere go! He smiled as the torch lit off.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0Then weight hit him.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0At three and one-half gravities he weighed six hundred and thirty pounds. It felt as if a load of sand had landed on him, squeezing his chest, making him helpless, forcing his head against his collar. He strove to relax, to let the supporting liquid hold him together. It was all right to tighten up for a pullout, but for a long boost one must relax. He breathed shallowly and slowly; the air was pure oxygen, little lung action was needed. But he labored just to breathe. He could feel his heart struggling to pump blood grown heavy through squeezed vessels. This is awful! he admitted. I\u2019m not sure I can take it. He had once had four g for nine minutes but he had forgotten how bad it was.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0His ribs hurt, each breath carried the stab of pleurisy. His hands and feet felt \u201Cpins-and-needles\u201D from scanty circulation. He wiggled them, which produced crawling sensations and wearied him. So he held still and watched the speed soar. It increased seventy-seven miles per hour every second, more than a quarter million miles per hour every hour. For once he envied rocketship pilots; they took forever to get anywhere but they got there in comfort.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0Without the torch, men would never have ventured much past Mars. E = Mc2, mass is energy, and a pound of sand equals fifteen billion horsepower-hours. An atomic rocketship uses but a fraction of one percent of that energy, whereas the new torchers used better than eighty percent. The conversion chamber of a torch was a tiny sun; particles expelled from it approached the speed of light.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDoctor, tell me straight: will Joe get well?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0\u201CNo, sir.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0\u201CWill he get better?\u2019\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0\u201CSome, perhaps. Lunar gravity makes it easy to get the most out of what a man has left.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0\u201CBut will his mind clear up?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0The doctor hesitated. \u201CIt\u2019s this way, sir. Heavy acceleration is a speeded-up aging process. Tissues break down, capillaries rupture, the heart does many times its proper work. And there is hypoxia, from failure to deliver enough oxygen to the brain.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0The Commodore struck his desk an angry blow.\u00A0\u00A0\u201CDamn it, man \u2014 think of the way he was.
