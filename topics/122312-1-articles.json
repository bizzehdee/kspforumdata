There are some shots of the piston gear in operation (sadly my screen-taking skills fell short of a half-decent gif animation, but hopefully you get the idea). The cab interior is loosely based on actual photographs of the real \u003Cem\u003EFlying Scotsman\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s cab, tho Kerbs being very short and scaling being tricky it is a bit wonky. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI began this as a stock project and fell to mods out of necessity - stock could do it, but it was ugly and the part count was/is terrifying. However, the only mods used are TweakScale and InfernalRobotics. With the exception of rotors for the wheels and connecting rods, and 2 IR gantries that just looked too \u0027right\u0027 to give up, all the parts are stock/rescaled. \u003Cstrong\u003EThere are 479 of them.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe vessel weighs in at 60.9 tonnes as configured, and could weigh considerably more - most of the fuel tanks are empty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like to think this locomotive belongs to an era in Kerbin\u0027s none-too-distant past, when rockets hadn\u0027t yet been mastered as interplanetary craft and other technologies were still attracting the limelight. Unlike her RL analog, the \u003Cem\u003EFlying Kerbman\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s top speed is (ahem \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:blush:\u0022\u003E) about \u003Cstrong\u003E2 m/s\u003C/strong\u003E. It seems Kerbals and steam-power just don\u0027t belong together, and much to the good or perhaps there would never have been a Kerbal X...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my defense, 2 m/s is pretty fast considering the mass of the thing, the number of moving parts and the fact that most of the propulsion force comes from the 6 torque/drivewheels. There is a rear-facing jet engine tucked away too, but truthfully that was mostly for the smoke effect - I think the jetwash actually collides with the tender. In any case, the wheels would implode if the vehicle exceeded about 6 m/s (which they did a number of times during development, as well as causing the runway to blow up).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeel free to tinker if you download the craft, and if you set a new speed record by all means post it up. Many of the parts are for looks rather than function, so if anyone wants a stripped down version to try out I can try to fix one for you \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-04T21:48:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt does look very nice!
