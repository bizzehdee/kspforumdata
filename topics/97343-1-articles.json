I often want a small arrow pointing to where im going in the orbit. Now i usually speed up time shortly to se where the craft seems to be going. Another thing i guess i could do is place a nav point and see where the prograde is pointing.. It is especially important when I plot a transition and want to know if the estimated orbit at the target planet is going to be clockwise or anticlockwise - sometimes hard to tell. Don\u0027t you think? Am I doing something wrong?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Shortcuts for time warp states. I want to quickly jump to a specific time warp state, and then with one button reset to x1.

The thing about the direction of flight is this situation: I\u0027m in map view, see my orbit and see my ship as an icon in the orbit. I can see the navball, and see the prograde marker, but since the ship icon doesnt show my orientation, it is still not immediately apparent from that screen weather, say, my orbit is clockwise or counter clockwise. Like, if I point my ship prograde in the navball, I still don\u0027t know if my ship is gonna go east or west in the orbit on map view. If I speed up time, I can se the ship drifting along in a certain direction, and then I know. But if there was just a little prograde point displayed right on the orbit in map view, that would help a lot. Or am I missing something obvious? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout time warp - sure, but I play with joystick with key binds, and use the mouse as little as possible.
