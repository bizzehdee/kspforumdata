While undoubtedly testing a launch clamp on the Mun or even a Jet engine anywhere above Low Kerbin orbit is silly, many other part test contracts are realistic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022/u/Kalloran\u0022 data-cite=\u0022/u/Kalloran\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP and testing, a pilot\u0027s perspective.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlright, so let\u0027s talk testing. I\u0027ve been seeing a ton of gripes on here about the part test profiles, their restrictions, and their very strict requirements. Most of these gripes have been along the lines that they are patently ridiculous, unnecessary and overly difficult to accomplish. I would like to point out that this is ACTUALLY how testing works. Test profiles for unknown parts are extremely stringent and require weeks, sometimes months, of repetitive flights in order to gather the necessary breadth data to analyze part performance. Test pilots spend day after day flying the aircraft within a very tight range of tolerances for the flight test engineers either in the aircraft or on the ground receiving data-linked telemetry and sensor information. If you exceed the tolerances by a little bit, you fly the profile again. You do this until you a) run out of fuel or \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E run out of crew duty day. In either case, you\u0027re most likely heading up tomorrow to fly the exact same profile. I had the opportunity to spend a week flying a test run for my company where I had to put the aircraft over a point on the ground \u002B/- 1 minute, \u002B/- 50 ft (altitude), and within 1% of a target aircraft gross weight in order for the test to be valid. If I messed up, it was back to the airfield to refuel and try again. I know that this statement smacks of realism, not game, but how many posts are on here and the boards about things not \u0022being realistic enough?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022But Kal, I can\u0027t engage my LV-XXX where it says, because the stage timing doesn\u0027t work right!\u0022 Ok, if you\u0027re going to take these contracts (which you don\u0027t have to do, btw), you \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E*gasp*\u003C/span\u003E might have to put forth some thought, consideration, planning, and, yes, MATH. MOAR STRUTS! MOAR BOOSTERS! Might not work! (Say it isn\u0027t so!!!). Consider launching the test vehicle at a 45* angle or less in order to maximize the time you spend within the test window. As you gain aircraft parts, consider creating flying testbeds to test parts: aircraft that you attach something to and then fly it into the test window to engage the test item. 14000m to 20000m at 250m/s to 450m/s is well within the flight envelope of aircraft in KSP, and it\u0027s recoverable. Most aviation corporations as well as governmental organizations keep an inventory of testbed aircraft (B-52\u0027s, BBJ\u0027s, G4\u0027s, Lears, SR-71, etc) for the purpose of strapping odd things to them to test performance. While I find the \u0022science mode\u0022 versus \u0022career mode\u0022 graphics as funny as anyone else, test aircraft really do look very odd.
