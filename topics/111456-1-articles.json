The initial idea was some sort of **ablative gel** coming out of small ports placed **underneath** the craft (think sun lotion), but that would require some **Vector3D** understanding, (and maybe worse, **ray tracing**), which is way **above** my **mental capacity**. So the decision was made to instead make **small ports** for one-use coolant fluid (Cool Goo TM). **However**, as I started dabbling around with the **air-combat missions** for the [**N.A.N.A contracts pack**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122785-Concept-WIP-The-Tales-of-N-A-N-A-Chapter-1-The-Fifth-Scientest?p=1966471#post1966471) I realized I also needed something to help **extend** some of the escort and protection **missions** as the [BDArmory](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/85209-1-0-BDArmory-v0-8-2-%28AI-pilots-smarter-guards-etc%29-Dev-Thread-May-8) **AI** are extremely **accurate** with the guns. So I thought I\u0027d hit two birds with the same stone, with **dual purpose**. Which is probably best as I realized after 1.0 released: It\u0027s **entirely possible** and relatively **easy** to **re-enter** Kerbin **without** so much as a single **temperature gauge** pop up, so it sort of made the add-on a bit redundant. **Nevertheless**! Here it is!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![1sasMba.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/1sasMba.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E Cool Goo TM? Aloe Vera? -- early experiments ahaha\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n**Parts**\n\nNo new models or textures (keeps the memory down). Stock Parts are recycled using [Module Manager](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55219-1-0-x-Module-Manager-2-6-5-%28May-24%29-With-more-nyan).\n\n![6VOpBR3.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/6VOpBR3.jpg)\n\nThe add-on introduces five new parts, and some new resources (where only one is player relevant).\n\n- A 1.25m In-line D.E.F.L.E.C.T.O.R Shield Generator. For avoiding Kerbals that kling on to your vessel when you\u0027re trying to launch.\n- A 2.50m In-line D.E.F.L.E.C.T.O.R Shield Generator. For use on the Fourth of July (may catch a cold).\n- A 3.75m In-line D.E.F.L.E.C.T.O.R Shield Generator. For use with your fully armed and operational battle station.\n- A Radial Container with Cool Goo TM. For storing extra Cool Goo TM.\n- A Radial Shield Booster. For improving shield integrity, at the cost of shield generator heat.\n\n All parts are located in the **Command and Contro**l tab.\n\n**Relations with other add-ons**\n\nDependencies:\n\n- [Module Manager](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55219-1-0-x-Module-Manager-2-6-5-%28May-24%29-With-more-nyan)\n\n Recommended:\n\n- [Heat Management](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/118189)\n\n For testing:\n\n- [BDArmory](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/85209-1-0-BDArmory-v0-8-2-%28AI-pilots-smarter-guards-etc%29-Dev-Thread-May-8)\n\n Incomparable:\n\n- *Reserved*\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Before Re-Entry, charge up your shields. This is done by right clicking the generator, setting the **Regen. Output** to an appropriate level and press the **Start Generator** button. The **Shield Integrity** bar should now start to rise. This will consume **Electric Charge** depending on the output level. You can leave the generator on even if it has reached 100%, as it will not consume charge. **Note** that higher output levels will cause the shield integrity to rise faster, however it is exponentially more Electric Charge consuming.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![xVXzeal.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/xVXzeal.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E Next up is to chose the **appropriate temperature** percentage at which you want your shields to start protecting. This can be done with the **Shield Threshold** slider. The default is 39% as the game will start showing temperature bars at 40% for most parts (it seems).\n\u003E \n\u003E As you reach atmosphere you should now push the **Shields Up** button to activate the shield. This can be done before-hand as it will have no detrimental effects as long as the temperature is not passing the Shield Threshold.\n\u003E \n\u003E When a parts temperature **reaches** the set **temperature threshold** the part will start **glowing blue**, indicating that it\u0027s being shielded (see top image for reference). When a part is being shielded you will start to lose **shield integrity**. The shield integrity loss is determined by how much heat the part should have had without shielding and the surface area of the part. You can counteract the loss by increasing the **Regen. Output**. As it is it is exponentially more costly to run at higher outputs, **careful balancing** is required so you do not risk running out of electric energy.\n\u003E \n\u003E As you start shielding, the **shield generator** will destabilize and start to heat up. The amount of heat is determined by the same values above. If your shield should reach critical levels, there is built in emergency **Cool Goo TM** reservoir which you can inject into the core to stabilize it and cool it down. However, it is highly recommended that you use [heat-sinks and radiators from Randazzo\u0027s Heat Management add-on](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/118189) as Cool Goo TM is, due to its special properties, expensive and hard to come by.\n\u003E \n\u003E If you should be in need of some **extra** shielding, you can radially mount a **shield booster** to the Shield Generator. The booster will vastly improve your shield integrity, however due to its unstable nature, it will also cause the shield generator to heat up easier.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![59tRlNN.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/59tRlNN.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E It is recommended that you strategically place the generator **within your vessel,** as the generator itself is not shielded. The generator also have **high heat conductivity** so it should not be attached to fragile parts. Ideally it should be isolated by using [heat-sinks](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/118189). Note that heat-sinks and radiators are not shielded.\n\u003E \n\u003E Lastly, having a **Scott** or a **Wookie** or a **blue droid** in the crew will improve your shield regeneration.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![pklvaGB.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/pklvaGB.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E Deflector Shield Cooling Tower for your capital ships perhaps?\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n**HELP testing and tweaking!**\n\nAs this type of add-on naturally comes with a large \u0022cheaty\u0022-factor, I wanted to make it a bit challenging to use. However, this proved to be extremely complicated as I have practically no knowledge in programming and game design (and physics for that matter). Thus, it may have ended up a bit too challenging. **Therefore I\u0027d like to enlist some help in trying to make it more balanced**. And if someone is really eager, help clean up, and improve the plug-in itself.\n\nI have only **tested** it with the type of ships that **I usually build**, and it have somewhat worked out. However, this may differ greatly from other peoples play style. My aim was to be able to **re-enter with stock, \u0022regular\u0022-sized crafts** (whatever that means), **with not too much hassle**. Then use heat-sinks, boosters and Cool Goo TM for larger ones. I.e. 1.25 are meant for 1.25 ships and MK2, 2.5 are meant for 2.5 and MK3 and 3.5 are meant for... those those star destroyers etc. The **2.5** and **3.75** are the **least tested**.\n\nI have **yet** to **test** it with **BDArmory**, but will probably need some tweaking for it to work. The **first priority** is to make it work for **re-entry**. I also have no idea how this will work with [Deadly Re-entry](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/54954-1-0-Deadly-Reentry-v7-0-3-update-May-14-2015-%28The-Melificent-Edition%29), or any other add-ons that has to do with heat.\n\n**To summarize:** It would be **very helpful** if you could **try it out** and **post your thoughts** about it**,** maybe even a **picture** of the vessel you tested it on, the total **surface area**, and **amount of parts** being **protected** (glowing blue).\n\nIf you are **.CFG adept**: All important variables are available to dabble around with, so I invite you to have a go!\n\nIf you are **C# adept,** I welcome you to have a look at the code (warning: very messy) to see how it\u0027s all calculated!\n\n**WARNING**\n\nThis is a very much a **work in progress** and needs tweaking to both code and game-play, and maybe even visuals, and should be used mainly for **testing** purposes (e.g. a **new save** or a **separate** **copy** of the game), as it may **destroy your save/game**. This is created by someone who\u0027s formal education is business innovation and marketing, as well as linguistics. Programming and game development-related things are merely something picked up by reading the KSP forums. **You have been warned!**\n\n**Known Issues** (That I don\u0027t really know how to fix yet)\n\n- Right-clicking the Shield Generator in the VAB/SPH will cause massive frame-drop.\n- Sound effects play while paused.\n- **Balancing**\n\n**Possible future things** (if I can get level up by that time)\n\n- More support parts (Shield boosters, Cool Goo TM tanks etc.).\n- Start/Stop sound effects.\n- Actual visual effects (when I figure out how to handle FXgroups)\n- Comparability for BDArmory\n- Proper GUI (if I can figure out how it\u0027s done)\n- Custom parts tab\n\n[**DOWNLOAD HERE!**](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/millaqfjs3bwtsh/AAAnCBT7Fx85490YDmRDCguga?dl=0)\n\n**Licence, source code etc**.\n\n- Licences for the respective add-ons referred to in this add-on are dictated by their specific creators.

Never tried it. Haha. I never imagined or intended such extreme speeds, but as Tyren said, there may be a chance if you have ridiculous amount of energy, and run on full capacity.\n\nYour question is actually a bit of a dilemma for me. While I was creating and testing this thing, I was thinking of this as a sort of \u0022multi-purpose, one-fits-all-shapes-of-ship heat-shield\u0022. Which, for a bit of extra weight and hassle, could get any \u0022normal\u0022 type of ship through the atmosphere at \u0022normal\u0022-ish or emergency conditions.\n\nBut the more I mess around with it, I\u0027m starting to think that maybe there is really no need for such after all. Since bringing the shield will add more mass and prompt less manoeuvrability, which is sort of what is (not) needed for normal aero-breaking anyway (and key factors for non-overheat re-entries). So it may be that bringing the shield generator will result in the need for it, and not bringing it results in not needing it. Sort of like having life-support generators (greenhouses) that basically converts LS of electric charge. Wouldn\u0027t need life-support function in the first place, it\u0027s just one more extra part.\n\nSo at the moment I\u0027m considering tuning it for a bit more \u0022ridiculous\u0022 use. o.O\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Update: tested it with my clean install, works pretty well. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\u003E Had a 4km/s reentry from Jool, the whole ship glowed blue ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) But the energy drain is remarkable, be sure to have enough energy generation with you. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nAhaha excellent!
