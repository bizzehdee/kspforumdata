And do so at a very morally questionable level. And it\u0027s got some really badass procedural generation stuff. It\u0027s hard to explain, but it LOOKS AMAZING.

Right now, it\u0027s already really detailed, but more is being planned - eventually, the developers want a fully simulated city, where the actions of single people all individually affect the high level simulation, to a huge extent. It\u0027ll even have little details, like the lights in buildings switching off all one-by-one as the denizens sleep and go through their lives, and the unpredictability of technological phenomenons such as memes and viral videos affecting the gameplay overall.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img.itch.io/aW1hZ2UvNDI4Ny8xNDYzNi5wbmc=/347x500/SH666y.png\u0022 alt=\u0022SH666y.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe game is set in a futuristic yet bleak world where advertising is everywhere, and you are part of it. You need to advertise for companies, try and maintain your relationships which these companies, and even eventually work up to a huge power, buying out corporations and expanding through both legal and illegal means... but always immorally. Eventually, a citizen can\u0027t look anywhere without seeing an advertisement on a billboard, in a shop window, on their phone, on blimps, or anywhere, really!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe game is made by people who love the technology behind it, and spend a lot of time reading up on studies and academic papers researching population densities, land values, terrain effects, and of course advertising. They are committed to having versions of the game on all platforms, and have written their own in-house engine so they aren\u0027t held back by any limitations. Every CPU calculation is used to the fullest, meaning even the biggest and most complex cities can run well on old hardware.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/001/760/686/a1fbfce3d2ea7eddab5371c0e23c888f_large.jpg?1395062092\u0022 alt=\u0022a1fbfce3d2ea7eddab5371c0e23c888f_large.jpg?1395062092\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBuy it on the Kickstarter early for a reduced price!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/voxelstorm/advertcity\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/voxelstorm/advertcity\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rasheed","CreatedById":29903,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-27T10:27:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooks interesting..\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MC.STEEL","CreatedById":89456,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-27T14:42:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIts nice to see how such wacky ideas are benefiting from kickstarter as traditional publishers wont fund much in something that they arent certain that they will get their investment back.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Riot","CreatedById":145914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T21:48:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust wanted to update this old thread - the game is now out and available on Steam!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESteam link: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://store.steampowered.com/app/365800\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://store.steampowered.com/app/365800\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDRM-free store link: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://voxelstorm.itch.io/advertcity\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://voxelstorm.itch.io/advertcity\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
