Was able to do a free return trajectory, and brought up a Science Jr. service bay with some science parts and the command module.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnly needed minor course adjustments on the way to avoid hitting the Mun itself, and plenty of fuel for course corrections on the return.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe return was the trickiest part. I was having a lot of trouble getting the craft back in one piece. Too steep and the science junior kept blowing up at around 30K, and too shallow would keep be from deorbiting at all. I imagine I would have still gotten down on the shallow passes, but since this was just Mun trio I wanted to do it in one shot (Apollo didn\u2019t need a bunch of aero brake orbits damn it!!!)\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nso I found 31K PE was able to do the trick, but I am not sure if it was just luck or the correct idea. Everything seemed to hit critical on the heat meters and I even began to gain altitude at around 30K, but after that I was able to safely land.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy question is was this the right idea, or just luck? What do you guys do to successfully return from Mun and further with a science payload?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor Minmis and other planets would it be more prudent to bring fuel to try and slow down on multiple orbits, or come in extra shallow for multiple orbits?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-09T12:05:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nApollo also didn\u0027t bring back the service module.\u00A0 Get rid of the science junior and you wouldn\u0027t have any trouble\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geonovast","CreatedById":179753,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-09T14:06:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUse this and ditch the experiments before re-entry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Experiment_Storage_Unit\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Experiment_Storage_Unit\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, for any advice involving craft design, screenshots are pretty much necessary.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zeta function","CreatedById":178370,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-10T18:10:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u00A0 set\u00A0my periapsis normally to 40k for mun returns.
