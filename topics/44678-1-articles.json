Thought I\u0027d share it. Reasonable sure it could be done more gracefully and I needed to use MechJeb to fly it for me. I\u0027m having an odd issue with two of the stages that are, sorta, asparagus staged. I have 4 tanks feeding into 4 other tanks. 1 empties 1st and the craft does an odd loop. I sorta caught it the 2nd time and shut of the engines and manually staged that one and only wobbled some. Any ideas why 1 out of 4 is emptying just a tiny bit faster? Is MechJeb possible altering throttle differently on each engine to correct for off balance? Dunno. Anyway I had to xfer some fuel to the last stage to finish the orbit but still put 4 full orange tanks and 1 almost full orange tank into 150k orbit. 5 docking ports, lots of RCS fuel, tons of battery and 4 gigantor arrays. Now let\u0027s see if I can add an image \u0026amp; the craft file. :-)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/44910027/Fuel%20me%20up%2C%20Buttercup.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/44910027/Fuel%20me%20up%2C%20Buttercup.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/44910027/Fuel%20Me%20Up%2C%20Buttercup!.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/44910027/Fuel%20Me%20Up%2C%20Buttercup!.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that works.
