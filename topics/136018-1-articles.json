But most of them require Hydrazine to work and for some reason, I cant find Hydrazine in my RealFuels options?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately, I uninstalled RSS/RO because it was taking up too much memory, so I can\u0027t send you pictures or anything.

To hold a highly-pressurized resource like hydrazine, you need a highly-pressurized tank. Starting out in career mode, the only tank of that type is Fuselage; later type ServiceModule becomes available as well (it\u0027s a bit more expensive but rather more efficient).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Navy2k","CreatedById":95246,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-05T09:06:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlways good to snoop around every RSS thread, had the same problem and will test fuselage on my early RP0 Career tonight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
