I have literally spent hours and hours taking care of tedious interplanetary transfers with long nuke burns to get this stuff done. 18-minute burns for Jool injection were common, with armadas of half a dozen ships. And physical time warp often didn\u0027t help because the ships had lots of parts...so even at 2x or 3x time warp, the game was still running at slower than real time for these burns. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore, the prospect of having to run my nukes at less than full throttle does not appeal to me at all. What used to take a few hours could take days of free time now. And having to add lots and lots of extra parts to combat the problem would only exacerbate the laaaaaaaag issue. So, at the moment, I don\u0027t think I\u0027d want to do any more missions with the new nuke limitations. So this makes me very sad...because I used to like playing KSP. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022regex\u0022 data-cite=\u0022regex\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnyway, I confirmed the suggestion being passed on, hopefully the heating will be reduced in the next update.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd thank you for that.
