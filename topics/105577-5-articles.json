Proper handling of rocketry (the rocket equation must work, etc. KSP does acceptably well here).\n\n2. Proper handling of orbital mechanics (we don\u0027t have n-body, but the patched conics works quite well).\n\n3. Everything else.\n\nThe only reason I play KSP is because it meets points 1 and 2. If it didn\u0027t, I\u0027d drop it like a hot Nerva.\n\nThe fact that KSP has purple planets and ice moons too close to the sun, and such things as these, does not annoy me a whole lot. I don\u0027t even mind the overly dense planets, since the devs need only posit the existence of a super-dense form of matter (perhaps baryons made from the heavier quarks are stable in the KSP universe)...and since that dense material only needs to live in the cores of the celestial objects where is isn\u0027t going to affect points 1 and 2 above, it won\u0027t hinder me enjoying the game. It can also explain why a low mass star can produce the luminosity we see from Kerbol, since the pressures and temperatures of the normal matter just outside the tiny super-dense core will allow conditions for fusion of the normal matter. \n\nThe water physics is moderately annoying...but this is a \u0022fly rockets around\u0022 game and not a boat game...but I surely hope they fix this at some point. But it doesn\u0027t mess with points 1 or 2 much, except for spacecraft recovery. KSP\u0027s aerodynamics were terrible before, but they are greatly improved in 1.0, so I mark those as acceptable now, but still with room for improvemment.\n\nThe lack of proper chemistry of the propellants annoys me...what exactly ARE fuel and oxidizer? I wished squad would pick some real propellants and use realistic numbers to determine their tank volumes and masses (and, no, the players who aren\u0027t interested in such things don\u0027t need to be concerned with the details)...since this affects point 1 for those who want to dig deep into the rocket science.\n\nI don\u0027t mind little green aliens. I don\u0027t mind the kerbal sensibility and humor. Those things can be in the game without affecting points 1 and 2...and they make the game fun.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-29T19:29:11Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2015 07:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Brotoro**"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T19:30:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E fun.\n\nThis is why I argue for the LV-N heat, honestly, I find it immensely fun.

I have literally spent hours and hours taking care of tedious interplanetary transfers with long nuke burns to get this stuff done. 18-minute burns for Jool injection were common, with armadas of half a dozen ships. And physical time warp often didn\u0027t help because the ships had lots of parts...so even at 2x or 3x time warp, the game was still running at slower than real time for these burns. \n\nTherefore, the prospect of having to run my nukes at less than full throttle does not appeal to me at all. What used to take a few hours could take days of free time now. And having to add lots and lots of extra parts to combat the problem would only exacerbate the laaaaaaaag issue.
