Unlocking science to find the monoliths or something. You were supposed to learn something at each monolith that would lead you to another, and so on. Eventually, you were supposed to discover... something. Aliens? Kerbal origins? Not sure. It was decided not to give the game a narrative because then it would have an \u0022end\u0022. Plus, everyone played the game differently, and the concept was working without any kind of story.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wouldn\u0027t be surprised if there was some implementation of that in the full release.

gathering in KSP 1 are the science gathering contracts\u003Cbr\u003E\nto be asked to take specific measurements at specific locations sound like real science gathering to me.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nbut i would love to have different type of science missions.\u003Cbr\u003E\nprototype missions to unlock parts by testing them in certain

areas of interest for new science)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nmy main suggestion is to make science mostly a subsection of the contract system.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe contract system is neat since it gives you missions based upon what you have done in the game so far.\u003Cbr\u003E\nif you place a surveyor in Duna orbit you would be more likely to get a science contract to the surface.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nif science is more focused on contracts we could have mission specific science parts. imagine being asked to build the James Kerman space telescope or the JKST for short, and to put it in a LaGrange point (yea i know N body physics is not in the game).\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\ndifferent contract Corporations could be focuses on different things\u003Cbr\u003E\nfor example the life on Duna society would like you to invest in Duna exploration missions and science.\u003Cbr\u003E\nif you do successful contracts for them they will give you bigger contracts in the future.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nbut the science gains from contracts should be diminishing returns for the same type of study on the same body.\u003Cbr\u003E\njust studying the mun would be boring, and going to other planets would give much more valuable science.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0
