What happens is that an asteroid is captured to use as a counterweight and put into a stable geostationary orbit, then a specialized lander runs a huge (massive! think Kerbodyne fuel tank size!) spool of what\u0027s called carbon nanotubes back to the Earth (Kerbin), where it is fixed to the ground. A car is then sent that can go up and down the CNT rope. Since carbon nanotubes are incredibly strong, the payload is appreciable, varying from one to ten tons. Just think of what one of these babies would do for your high-level space program: no more having three-quarters of your rocket be fuel! Fill that space with: fuel for the return journey! IRSU reactors! Science labs! I\u0027d also suggest having varying levels of payload capacity. Perhaps new motors that each pull 1.5 tons each, simply, and instead of Launching your new rocket or spaceplane, simply send it on up the tether. As in real life, the transit times would be pretty long, though- about a day to get something into LKO.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T19:21:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EReally don\u0027t see how Space Elevators would ever work not to say if something went wrong and it all came back down but in all get your kerbal and alot of trusses and ladders and start building lol.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"John FX","CreatedById":59415,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T19:29:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think it will never happen in KSP.
