And at the contrary, if you look at a very \u0022general\u0022 plane of the earth, or in the earth plane perpendicular to you in that imaginary EVA, you\u0027ll see a \u0022clear\u0022 earth with a barely visible coloration/fog-effect coming from the atmosphere scattering.  \n\nSo, IMHO, there is no solution until we can get a barely decent HDR in KSP, which could cover an enhancement of all those small changes of \u0022perception\u0022.\n\nMeanwhile, we must settle a concrete look and, [@blackrack](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/104258-blackrack/), humbly I vote in favour of that last kerbin look.
