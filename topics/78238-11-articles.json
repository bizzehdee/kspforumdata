But I believe StageRecovery has some different values that it displays than DebRefund (I haven\u0027t actually looked at what DebRefund displays in a while, so I don\u0027t recall what all is displayed exactly) and everything is being developed independently. Though Vendan did give me permission to look at DebRefund\u0027s integration with the message system so that I could use it in my mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore people even start suggesting it, StageRecovery and DebRefund are not copies of each other, both were originally developed separately and are even now developing separately, which is good for both of them. I have contributed bug fixes and examples to Vendan and I have also learned from him (an example: I was the one who first mentioned that he was refunding higher than the actual part cost and provided an alternative, and his implementation of the stock message system is how I learned to use it). StageRecovery had Kerbal recovery first, but DebRefund got science recovery working first. And if you look at the features each has now, I think you\u0027d agree that they\u0027re branching off from the similar core system they share. The only reason I continued StageRecovery is because I was tired of waiting for DebRefund to have some sort of API for use with my primary mod, now I\u0027m continuing it as a standalone expansion for my primary mod, Kerbal Construction Time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cerebrate","CreatedById":110690,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-31T04:22:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually, here\u0027s another feature request:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EParts in KAS containers (KAS\u0027s own, or the Universal Storage KAS wedge) don\u0027t appear to be being counted/refunded.
