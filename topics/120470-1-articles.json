My ship is a single-stage lander with about 5300 m/s deltaV in space. It is capable of landing on all landable bodies, and of returning from all but Eve. I would have put Science on it (I could really gather a ton) but I built it in Sandbox mode, and I am definitely NOT going back to do a few tweaks to the design and then do the ENTIRE mission again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI took screenshots throughout. After carefully sorting through almost a hundred pictures to pick out the important ones, the page reloaded and I lost all my progress so I said screw it and uploaded them all. Apparently I can\u0027t just upload an album with 749 pictures, so I\u0027ll just upload several albums which in sequence will give the full scope of the mission. I also am not going to put descriptions of \u003Cem\u003Eevery single picture\u003C/em\u003E especially since most of it is pretty trivial, like transfer burns and parachutes opening.

After I refueled on Minmus, I didn\u0027t really have to care about efficiency for a while. Landing on Ike went well, but Duna took a couple of tries. After that, I went to Dres. That also was pretty uneventful, I landed in a flat area that looks like a crater got filled in with dirt, with the downside that the landscape was as exciting as Iowa. Then I went off to the Jool System. I decided to go to Laythe first. The landing was ok, but the launch went sour, at which point I discovered I had not quicksaved on the surface. So I had to land again. It took a couple tries, but I remembered to quicksave on the surface and again attempted an ascent. The ship liked flipping once I got to Mach 1, so I decided to orient towards prograde and do minor adjustments from there. The ascent wasn\u0027t very efficient because of the tendency to point the other way, and then the engines glitched and stopped producing thrust \u003Cem\u003Eunless I was pressing the rotation keys.\u003C/em\u003E I figured it out and went with it, but once I got to orbit, I couldn\u0027t get anywhere else. So I landed again. The first spot I went to didn\u0027t have ore, so I reloaded and went closer to the original flag. It worked, I refueled, the ship launched much better, and so I went to Pol.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/Ub0hD/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTimewarp ate my ship, so I reloaded and tried again. That time it worked, flag planted, ship refueled. I went to Tylo after that. The first time, I started my landing burn way too late and crashed. Second time, though, it went flawlessly. Then I went back to Pol because it takes the least dV. The timewarp thing happened many times. That should be fixed. Eventually I landed successfully and refueled. I went to Vall afterwards, and the game teleported me underground...or something like that. It caught me by surprise the first time, but second time I landed fine. After getting back up into orbit, Bop was the last place to visit. I got into a polar orbit, and noticed something on the ground. *SPOILERS EASTER EGG*\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI landed by it and it was the dead Kraken. I planted a flag on it, refueled, and went to the equator. Looking back, it was pretty pointless because of my already inclined Joolian orbit.

Landed in a slightly less flat area, but it was juuuust fine. My parachutes gave me a little trouble on Duna, so I just went down all-powered. All was fine, got back to orbit fine, and went to the Mun. Getting to the Mun and seeing Kerbin in the sky made me feel really homesick for Kerbin, but I still had work to do. I went deeper towards Kerbol to Eve and it\u0027s moon Gilly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/hoP7E/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter landing on Gilly, I tried really, really hard to get in a situation where I *might* be able to get to Eve and back.

So I performed a quicksave transplant with the Gilly quicksave I had saved on my desktop from earlier, and went to Moho, the last planet I had left. I got into orbit, landed, refueled, planted flag, launched, got into orbit again, and then, it was finally time to go home. It took a few orbits to get a close approach, and I tweaked it into an encounter. Aerobraking took a few tries, a few orbits, and a few explosions before I finally splashed down in the ocean east of the KSC. Jeb, Bill, Bob, and Val arrived safely home, and their vessel in one piece after 66 years and a lot of quicksaves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOTHER INFO:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only mod I used was BetterTimeWarp, to make the long transfers less tedious I didn\u0027t use the Physics Warp function of the mod because I didn\u0027t know if it would be legal, and it always seems to make my ships explode anyway. The ship was built fully stock.
