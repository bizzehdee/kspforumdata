What advantage does Linux offer in this regard?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, everything really. AFAIK Windows can set resolution and set one display as primary. That\u0027s it. Windows 98 could do as much, and only improvement I could find in win7 are some \u0022dualhead\u0022 wallpapers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, I have KSP set up in windowed mode of same size as display, and window manager is configured to make it borderless, positioned at center of second display. This gives me \u0022fullscreen\u0022 game without locking mouse inside. Real story here is dedicated process that manages desktop and, among other things, can enforce positioning and size (and much more) on any window. While this is useful in general, I\u0027m sure you can see how this is incredibly handy on dualhead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWindows programs handle their windows themselves and it shows - some can remeber their position, some can even correctly handle maximized state, most of them not. Some can\u0027t tell maximized from fullscreen and have problems with focus stealing. Some work great, other can\u0027t stand such gross transgression as panel on top of screen instead of bottom. It\u0027s a mess. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo compare with my example, KSP on Windows is ilustration on how to make dualhead most painful experience possible. It starts in center of \u0022desktop\u0022 to get all advantages of being cut in half, but is not smart enough to actually span over all that space. If it just picked one screen at random, it would have at least 50% chance to get it right. Even if wrong, it would be clearly visible and not broken in halves. But no, its better to make you move it by hand every ****ing time, right?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"radonek","CreatedById":84077,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-20T15:55:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KerbMav\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KerbMav\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDoes this bug always happen?
