No fuel lines. Now if I just looks at each of these engines and corresponding fuel tank individually, then MechJeb tells me I should get 58s of thrust for all of them, but when I put it all together and launch, what happened is that first the radial mainsails run out of fuel, then a little later the central one, and then finally the TV-T30s. Now all I can figure is that is happening because my T800s are actually attached by means of a tail connector for reasons of prettiness, and since the model snaps together in such a way that the TV-T30s appear below the jumbo-64, they\u0027re somehow drawing fuel from the 64s first rather than the T800s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I guess my question is what determines which tank an engine first draws fuel from, and how might I get around this particular problem? I tried adding fuel lines from the T800s straight to the LV-T30s, but they still seemed to be draining the jumbos first.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dkmdlb","CreatedById":70275,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-12T15:43:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan you post a picture?

It\u0027s part of the nature of how KSP puts together rockets - its a tree-like structure, you have a root part and branches off of a part. I\u0027d bet good money that you put the Tail Connector on the Jumbo before you added the FL-T800s, right? Well, as far as the game\u0027s concerned, the LV-T30s is a branch of the FL-T800 is a branch of the Tail connector is a branch of the Jumbo 64. The Mainsail is a branch of the Jumbo 64, and since it is on a separate branch from the Tail Connectors, it has no association with the FL-T800s. Thus, the furthest connecting fuel supply for the LV-T30s is the Jumbo64, and the furthest connecting fuel supply for the Mainsails (again, considering this root-branch relationship structure) is \u003Cstrong\u003Ealso\u003C/strong\u003E the Jumbo64.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain I \u003Cem\u003Ethink\u003C/em\u003E that\u0027s what\u0027s going on; we\u0027d all need to see a screenshot or a posted craft file to be absolutely 100% sure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuel lines from the 800s to the 64 incidentally will not solve the issue - thought I\u0027d through that in there real quick. You wind up with a fuel loop as a result and KSP really doesn\u0027t know what to do with thems; you could get any kind of behavior out a loop, most often the fiery and destructive kind that makes Jeb happy then dead.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
