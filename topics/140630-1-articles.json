You could say the indefinite amount of time the probe could spend on the surface negates that idea, but the fact that the probe would \u003Cem\u003Ehave\u003C/em\u003E to use that time to deliver comparable results still supports the idea of human exploration.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpace exploration in general already suffers from results not being delivered in a timely manner despite the massive investment.
