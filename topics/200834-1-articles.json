Not sure if this is the right forum to ask this question, but hope it is.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m a new player to KSP. I\u0027ve played it for a bit a while back. I think i got as far as doing a Mun fly-by.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nLife happened, I got distracted. Now, I\u0027d like to return to it and give a good shot and learn it properly.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever, i\u0027m unsure of the mods that would best suit me. I\u0027ll briefly outline what I\u0027m looking for, and I\u0027d appreciate if you\u0027d advise best mods to do the job.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn order of priority, i\u0027m looking for the following:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n1. Something that is rewarding, but that will not require me to read 3000 pages\u00A0 of wikis and hours of YT videos.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. Highest quality environmental and part visuals for maximum immersion\u003Cbr\u003E\n3. Ability to replicate actual space program ships (Apollo, Space Shuttle, Soyuz) and photo realistic rocket/part\u00A0models\u003Cbr\u003E\n4. A sensible simple to complex career progression that helps you learn the game, but that is not a crazy grind or too dificult/risky. E.g. not interested in managing crew training, upgrades, construction time etc like RP-1 forces you to do. More like the stock KSP career.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo far, for visuals, top of my list are AVP \u002B Parallax for stock KSP, and RSSVE, Extreme Texture Overhaul and FASA for environmental and ship parts.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E for realistic rockets parts and planets.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe mods that i\u0027m on the fence about are RP-1, mostly.\u00A0 My main question is, is a new player able to play \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E without RP-1?\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nDoes \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E include Apollo/Shuttle/Soyuz parts or do I need a mod like FASA to obtain those?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIs it possible to reduce RP-1 difficulty settings to eliminate construction time, crew training and give more starting money and faster science?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs a beginner, I\u0027d rather just focus on rocket design and enjoying the game rather than worrying if my next crash is going to put my space program out of business or if Jeb is not ready for that new mission or capsule.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJunyo\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"paul_c","CreatedById":208135,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-07T10:40:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am not sure why you have dismissed simply starting out in KSP (again) with no mods, then perhaps adding a sprinkle of them as you progress.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-10T13:07:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2019m going to say it now- don\u2019t go for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E unless you\u2019re well and truly familiar with KSP. It\u2019s a very steep learning curve and you will definitely need to do a lot of work- reading guides, watching tutorial videos etc.- to make the most of it.\u00A0If you haven\u2019t even landed on the Mun yet, you\u2019re not ready. Not even close.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStart again in career (or science) mode in the stock system, use a minimal number of mods- graphics and tools are OK, but go easy on parts mods as they can just add confusing clutter and slow your load times- and only once you\u2019ve landed Kerbals on the Mun and Minmus and probes on at least one other planet should you consider trying something a bit more challenging like sending a crewed mission to Duna and probes to land on Jool\u2019s moons. You don\u2019t have to land on everything before stopping a particular play through, set yourself some specific goals and don\u2019t be afraid to leave it when you complete those goals; there\u2019s no fixed end point in KSP!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u2019re looking for parts to fill certain gaps in the stock part lineup then there are a number of options- my personal favourites are Restock and the Near Future series but there are many more to choose from if you don\u2019t like that particular style. In terms of graphics mods, you\u2019ll probably need \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E and scatterer plus a config mod\u00A0like AVP or Spectra (I personally like Spectra better), then there\u2019s distant object enhancement, planet shine and engine lighting to name just a few. Tools\u00A0like MechJeb can make your life much easier, but there are several that I recommend for specific things- gravity turn to launch your rockets efficiently and consistently, stage recovery to recover the dropped stages and get refunds for them, Astrogator for when you\u2019re going to other planets and where can I go to see if you can get there in the editor, and Bon Voyage so your rovers can drive themselves. You could even try a different tech tree that, for example, puts probes first and crewed capsules later, or adding a mod for life support, part failures or a different science system (Kerbalism does all three of those) to add more of a challenge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want to try a new solar system later on, there\u00A0are plenty of options out there- additions to the stock system like OPM and MPE (AVP works with OPM but spectra does not, keep that in mind); more stock(ish) scale solar systems like Beyond Home, Galileo\u2019s planet pack and/or Grannus expansion; and\u00A0larger scale systems like JNSQ or the rescale mod to resize the stock system. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E are very challenging and it\u2019s best to build up to them by trying gradually more difficult playthroughs\u00A0with the difficulty settings turned up and/or more mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlternatively, try some of the many and widely varied challenges on the forums- from the lightest and cheapest rocket to orbit to landing on every planet and moon possible to using the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E as an obstacle course,\u00A0there\u2019s going to be something that you like the looks of and which will challenge your creativity and improve your skills one way or another.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E and RP-1 is not for beginners; trust me, I\u2019ve tried it twice- the first time I tried, I was still fairly new to KSP, the experience was horrible and I lasted\u00A0less than an hour before giving up;\u00A0the second time around, over a year later, I actually understood how to do things in KSP a lot better and it has been an enjoyable, but very challenging, experience so far.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJumping from Mun flyby to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E is like learning to walk and then immediately trying to run a marathon.

My first run at it took about 5 hours from when I first started trying to install \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E to when I was able to fulfill the \u0022First Launch\u0022 contract, because of how long it took to install, how many tutorials I had to read and how many times I had to fix something on my spacecraft.
