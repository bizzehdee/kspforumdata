I actually made this account just to find a fix to this problem. Well, let\u0027s get to the point. Most of my rockets lately have been inexplicably losing control for no reason (that I can find). I get a decent way up out of the atmosphere and then the camera just zooms out and the rocket up everywhere after a few seconds.\u003Cimg src=\u0022KSP_150708_1403038.PNG\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP_150708_1403038.PNG\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022Rocket.PNG\u0022 alt=\u0022Rocket.PNG\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second screenshot is where it starts messing up. the rocket is 590 tons and it uses a protective shell to deliver its payload (a kethane mining Mun lander). It worked perfectly fine when it delivered a slightly smaller kethane surveyor to orbit the mun. This problem also affects my spaceplanes when I turn too fast or if I just fly straight for about 15 seconds. I have been playing KSP for about 2 months now and I have never experienced this problem before. If you guys can help I would REALLY appreciate it. I am on version 1.0.0.830 and have MechJeb, Radial Engine Mounts(Not on rocket), Kethane, BDarmory(not on rocket) and TweakScale(not on rocket) mods. So the only mods used on the rocket is MechJeb and Kethane. I only used Kethane on the successful kethane scanner (obviously) but I have never had a problem with MechJeb before so I don\u0027t think its that.
