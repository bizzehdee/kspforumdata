The only effect the new joint system has for me right now is that I can\u0027t test the robotic parts in-game, delaying their release. That being said, the delay gives me the opportunity to work on parts that have been on my to-do list for a while (such as these ship trusses), and ultimately produce an even bigger release! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"smunisto","CreatedById":57789,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-07T10:51:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGreat,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esorry, now that I look again at your pictures - I do notice it\u0027s a modular design, not one piece.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I tried drawing what I mean on top of one of your pictures, but the isometric perspective defies my Paint drawing abilities \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps if you can\u0027t understand the explanation that will follow, you can P.M. me with a top-down view of this \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.cubby.com/pl/ShipTrussx2.jpg/_7f7c0d95613446a3bcbd83efb10172ad\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Epicture\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe trusses(or the walls of the modular section, as the trusses probably have some standard that they comply to with regard to the whole mod) have to be small enough, so that they leave some truss \u0026lt;-\u0026gt; wall edge space.
