So you get 3 drag components that add up to the overall drag vector going in the opposite direction of your velocity.\u00A0 So I think the dot product comes before the drag equation to get the velocity components, and then the drag equation for the 3 sides and get the drag components and then the overall drag vector.\u00A0 Also wondering if theres skin friction drag, or if its\u00A0all 90 degrees from the faces?\u00A0 I think probably pressure drag and stuff is all included in the Cd and multipliers.\u00A0\u00A0I found this in the physics.cfg\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDRAG_TIP // Multiplier to dragcube drag when the face points towards the velocity vector, x value is mach, y value is multiplier\u003Cbr\u003E\n{\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0key = 0 1 0 0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0key = 0.85 1.19 0.6960422 0.6960422\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0key = 1.1 2.83 0.730473 0.730473\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0key = 5 4 0 0\u003Cbr\u003E\n}\u003Cbr\u003E\nDRAG_SURFACE // Multiplier to dragcube drag when the face points orthogonal to the velocity vector, x value is mach, y value is multiplier\u003Cbr\u003E\n{\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0key = 0 0.02 0 0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0key = 0.85 0.02 0 0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0key = 0.9 0.0152439 -0.07942077 -0.07942077\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0key = 1.1 0.0025 -0.005279571 -0.001936768\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0key = 2 0.002083333 -2.314833E-05 -2.314833E-05\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0key = 5 0.003333333 -0.000180556 -0.000180556\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0key = 25 0.001428571 -7.14286E-05 0\u003Cbr\u003E\n}\u003Cbr\u003E\nDRAG_TAIL // Multiplier to dragcube drag when the face points away from the velocity vector, x value is mach, y value is multiplier\u003Cbr\u003E\n{\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0key = 0 1 0 0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0key = 0.85 1 0 0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0key = 1.1 0.25 -0.02215106 -0.02487721\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0key = 1.4 0.22 -0.03391732 -0.03391732\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0key = 5 0.15 -0.001198566 -0.001198566\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0key = 25 0.14 0 0\u003Cbr\u003E\n}\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConfused about how this fits in, especially the orthogonal.\u00A0 I think the orthogonal is 90 degrees from your velocity, mabey theres some range of some degrees to set it to orthogonal?\u00A0 Or possibly after the dot product it takes the one closest face as foreward, the other two as foreward orthogonal, the backwards one as tail, and the other two backwards ones as backward orthogonal?\u00A0 Also what is\u00A0the depth in the cubes?\u00A0 I think thats like a capsule is wider at the base than the top, so the area is at an angle, but Im not sure how the depth effects the calculations\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-02-13T08:51:07Z\u0022 title=\u002202/13/2018 08:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 13, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by At4851\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
