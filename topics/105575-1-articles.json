They are intentionally uncapped because if everything is capped, the board might not have anything to choose from. This was made configurable, however.\n\nTo answer the original post, this can happen rarely if you get \u0022lucky\u0022, and happen to roll six rescues. However, most of the time, it happens when you have a weird progression of some kind - such as fully upgrading your base with cheated funds, or HyperEditing to various planets. This can confuse the contract system, as it assumes you did these things over time.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T09:38:30Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 09:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Arsonide**"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T10:05:41Z","Content":"Gah!\n\nI haven\u0027t been getting any rescue contracts, on the other hand, and was actually starting to wonder if they\u0027d been removed.
