# KSP Forums Data

Scraped and stored as JSON

## Issues

If you notice any issues with articles missing, or titles being incorrect, please raise an issue with the topic ID that has the problem and I will resolve the issue ASAP.

## Forum Structure

The forums themselves, and the hierarchical structure is in ksp-forum-def.json

## Topics

the topics directory contains metadata, and post data for all KSP forums topics.

## Uploads

file upload data that was uploaded to the forums themselves (and was stored on amazon s3)

## Profiles

WIP of all the profiles on the forums with a limited amount of metadata

## Source code

coming soon, i would prefer to get a complete set of data for the above before showing the source and allowing T2 to somehow try and block this from happening.
